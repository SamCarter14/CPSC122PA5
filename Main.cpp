Programming Assignment: PA5
Description: This program keeps track of a song library, where you can add, store, delete, edit, and load or push songs.
Notes: Learned out to use stoi() from freecodecamp
If a function says NA for date created/modified, it was given in started code by teacher Gina Sprint. If it was NA for both, it was already filled. If it was just NA for created, it still needed to be edited.
